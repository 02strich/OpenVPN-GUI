OpenVPN-GUI
==========

This is a fork of the famous OpenVPN software including a slighly patched version of the OpenVPN-GUI for windows.

The following things have been changed:
 * the "openvpn-gui-1.0.4-en.exe" now asks for elevation as it needs it on Windows Vista and 7
 * the installer now also uninstalls the software correctly on Windows 7
