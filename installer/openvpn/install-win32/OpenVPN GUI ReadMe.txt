Installation Instructions for OpenVPN GUI for Windows
-----------------------------------------------------

You can either get my installation package for OpenVPN 2.0.X where I've
bundled the gui in the installation package, or you can use the original
installation package from OpenVPN, and then manually install OpenVPN GUI.


Installation using the bundled OpenVPN package with OpenVPN GUI included
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Download openvpn-2.0.X-gui-1.0.X-install.exe from 
  http://openvpn.se

* If you have a previous version of OpenVPN GUI installed, shut it down.
  Make sure it's closed by ALL logged on users.

* Run the install program. During the installation you can choose if the GUI
  should be started automatically at system startup. The default is yes.

* Create a xxxx.ovpn config-file with your favorite texteditor and save it in:
  C:\Program files\OpenVPN\config\. You should NOT use the "log" or "log-append"
  options as OpenVPN GUI redirect the normal output to a log file itself. 
  There is a sample config files in the "sample-config" folder. Please
  refer to the OpenVPN project homepage for more information regarding 
  creating the configuration file. http://openvpn.net/


Manual installation of OpenVPN GUI
----------------------------------

* Download and install OpenVPN from http://openvpn.net/

* Download openvpn-gui-1.0.X.exe and save it in OpenVPN's bin folder.
  Default is "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\bin\". You must put it in this folder
  because OpenVPN GUI depends on the OpenSSL DLLs installed in this folder by
  OpenVPN.

* Create a xxxx.ovpn config-file with your favorite texteditor and save it in:
  C:\Program files\OpenVPN\config\. You should NOT use the "log" or "log-append"
  options as OpenVPN GUI redirect the normal output to a log file itself. 
  There is a sample config files in the "sample-config" folder. Please
  refer to the OpenVPN project homepage for more information regarding 
  creating the configuration file. http://openvpn.net/

* Put a short-cut to openvpn-gui-1.0-X.exe in your 
  "Start->All Program->StartUp" folder if you want the gui started automatically
  when you logon to Windows.

* Start the GUI by double-clicking the openvpn-gui-1.0.X.exe file.

*** You need to be Administrator the first time you run OpenVPN GUI for it to
    create its registry keys. After that you don't have to be administrator
    just to run the GUI, however OpenVPN requires the user to be
    administrator to run! ***


Using OpenVPN GUI
-----------------

When OpenVPN GUI is started your config folder (C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config)
will be scanned for .ovpn files, and an icon will be displayed in the taskbar's
status area.

If you do not have any openvpn connection running, the config dir will be
re-scanned for new config files every time you open the OpenVPN GUI menu by
right-clicking the icon.

When you choose to connect to a site OpenVPN GUI will launch openvpn with
the specified config file. If you use a passphrase protected key you will be
prompted for the passphrase.

If you want OpenVPN GUI to start a connection automatically when it's started,
you can use the --connect cmd-line option. You have to include the extention
for the config file. Example:

openvpn-gui --connect office.ovpn


Run OpenVPN GUI as a Non-Admin user
-----------------------------------

OpenVPN currently does not work as a normal (non-admin) user. OpenVPN GUI
2.0 will solve this by using an enhanced version of the OpenVPN service
to start and stop openvpn processes.

In the mean time, it is possible to use OpenVPN GUI to control the current
OpenVPN Service to start and stop a connection.

To use OpenVPN GUI to control the OpenVPN service, set the registry value
"service_only" to '1'. See the section about registry values below.

Limitations with this way:
  
  There is no way for OpenVPN GUI ta hand over a password to the service
  wrapper, so you can't use passphrase protected private keys or 
  username/password authentication.

  If you have multiple openvpn configurations, all will be started and
  stopped at the same time.

  OpenVPN GUI is not able to retrieve any status info about the connections
  from OpenVPN, so it will report connected as soon as the service is
  started regarless of if OpenVPN has really succeded to connect or not.

  You cannot see the OpenVPN log in real-time.


Run Connect/Disconnect/Preconnect Scripts
-----------------------------------------

There are three diffrent scripts that OpenVPN GUI can execute to help
with diffrent tasks like mapping network drives.

Preconnect  If a file named "xxx_pre.bat" exist in the config folder
            where xxx is the same as your OpenVPN config file name,
            this will be executed BEFORE the OpenVPN tunnel is established.

Connect     If a file named "xxx_up.bat" exist in the config folder
            where xxx is the same as your OpenVPN config file name,
            this will be executed AFTER the OpenVPN tunnel is established.

Disconnect  If a file named "xxx_down.bat" exist in the config folder
            where xxx is the same as your OpenVPN config file name,
            this will be executed BEFORE the OpenVPN tunnel is closed.
